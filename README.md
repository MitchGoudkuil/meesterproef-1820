#### Meesterproef
During the meesterproef I worked together with Arash Paknezad, Guus Dijkhuis, Stijn Aa and Nathan Keyzer on a project called overhoorbot. Overhoorbot is an interrogate bot used by younger students to get ready before tests. The website of the overhoorbot is:
[www.overhoorbot.nl](www.overhoorbot.nl ). The repository of the overhoorbot is listed down below.

We also had to make an Design rationale in which we documented the way the application works, how it is coded and which choices we made during the proces.

#### Product Biography and reflection
During the project I wrote down all the activities i did and documented it. After the project was done I took a look at the weekly proces and my learning goals to see if I completed them. All of this is written down in the product biography.

As a part of the Minor web development we also had to write three articles, go and see different company's in Amsterdam called the weekly Mingle, and see some lectures. All of this documentation can be found down below.

#### Links to the articles
I also wrote two articles in which I explain how javascript modules work and how you can make some basic css animations with a svg.
